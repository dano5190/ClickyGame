# ClickyGame

This program uses REACT.JS to create a game where the player clicks on the pictures to get enough points to win.  After a picture is clicked, the pictures will shuffle around.  If the same picture is clicked twice in the same game, the game resets and the game is lost.

Currently, the program is incomplete.  The pictures do not shuffle and the pictures do not reset after clicked.

These will be fixed in the future.

The project has not been deployed yet, it will be in the future.
